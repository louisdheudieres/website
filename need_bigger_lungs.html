        <div class="text">Kathryn Williams, tuba<br>1 minute</div><br>

        <div class="text"> Written for Kathryn Williams's <a href="http://www.kathryngwilliams.com/coming-up-for-air.html">Coming Up For Air</a> project, in which each piece must last a maximum of one breath. Kathryn's project was inspired from her recovering from chronic respiratory conditions. Seeking a personal connection with the idea of breath, I went back to my teenage years, during which I played the tuba fairly seriously. During this time, I was frequently told that my sound wasn't big enough, and that I needed to develop my lung capacity. This piece has Kathryn embody my perspective, articulating the need to have bigger lungs, before finishing her breath with one note on the tuba.</div><br>
