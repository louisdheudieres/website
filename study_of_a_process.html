        <div class="text">Study of a Process was inspired by the Barocci: Brilliance and Grace exhibition at the National Gallery, London in 2013. In this exhibition, more of the Baroque painter's sketches were displayed than finished works, prompting me to question what the difference was between the two, or even if there was a significant one. Translating this idea of the 'unfinished' into music, I decided to make a piece where the audience witnesses a musician coming into contact with a score for the first time. This subverts the usual concert situation, in which this contact has already happened, and the relationship between the two (performer/score) has reached a point of stability.
